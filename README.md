# Python script to download all the audio files of the famous podcast by [@wesbos](https://twitter.com/wesbos) and [@stolinski](https://twitter.com/stolinski)

Check out the podcast at [here](https://syntax.fm/)

## Steps to download files:

1. Download the save.py in a folder
2. Run the script in the terminal
3. Give the starting episode number
4. Give the ending episode number
5. Wait for download
6. Enjoy and star the repo if you find it useful

If any error arises check the URL and if the problem persists check [this](https://github.com/wesbos/Syntax/tree/master/shows) repo to get the URL for that episode and then open a pull request to make the changes so that others don't go through this.

MOTIVATION: Wanted to listen to the podcast in offline mode and but too lazy to go through every link and press the download so I gave my basic python knowledge a test and rest is history!
